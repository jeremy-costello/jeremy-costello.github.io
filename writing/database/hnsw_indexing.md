Hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) is an algorithm for approximate nearest neighbour search. Similarity search in pgvector uses exact nearest neighbour search by default. They also provide a HNSW index for performing approximate nearest neighbour search, trading off lower recall for higher speed. This is what the semantic search (and chatbot retrieval) use for finding similar documents. Embeddings in the database are normalized, so inner product similarity is used rather than cosine similarity since they produce the same results on normalized vectors.
